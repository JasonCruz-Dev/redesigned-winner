## ***Important Factors***

### The most important success factor is to produce the best solution you can to solve the problem. There are many aspects to consider within that context – efficiency, performance, documentation, etc. Code to perform the algorithm is the minimum requirement. Your deliverable should contain enough to give us a glimpse into your analysis, your approach, your skills, or anything else that will demonstrate your ability as a software developer. We will be looking for a good approach, a glimpse into your thought process, things you can do to impress us, and clean and efficient code. We’re your potential customer for this assignment, show us what you’ve got.
